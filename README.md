# PromPress

PromPress is a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) client as a WordPress Plugin. It requires an in-memory store and supports [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [Memcached](https://memcached.org/). It differs from the [PHP client library](https://github.com/Jimdo/prometheus_client_php) by supporting pre-defined WordPress metrics, to simplify setting up WordPress monitoring.

## Early Development

This is still in very early development and as such is unlikely feature complete and will contain bugs. I will create releases once it is ready for general use.

I have attempted to comply with the [guidelines](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_clientlibs/) where possible, please open a ticket to discuss issues.
